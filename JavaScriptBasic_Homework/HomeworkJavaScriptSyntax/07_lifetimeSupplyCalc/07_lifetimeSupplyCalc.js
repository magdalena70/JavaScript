//Write a JavaScript function calcSupply(age, maxAge, food, foodPerDay)
//that accepts the following parameters: your age(years), your maximum age(years),
//your favorite food name(e.g. "chocolate"), estimate amount of your favorite food per day(a number).
//The function calculates how many of the food you will eat for the rest of your life.
//Write JS program lifetimeSupplyCalc.js that calculates the amount of a few foods that you will eat.
//The result should be printed on the console.Run the program through Node.js.
//Note: we assume that there are no leap years.
